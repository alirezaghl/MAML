# MAML for HalfCheetah Backward Locomotion

A PyTorch implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) applied to the HalfCheetah backward locomotion task using MuJoCo.

## Overview

This project implements MAML to train a policy that can quickly adapt to make a HalfCheetah run backward. 

### Result
The training produces an evaluation video showing the trained agent performing backward locomotion.
